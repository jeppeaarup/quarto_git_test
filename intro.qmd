A histogram can be useful for investigating empirical distributions @fig-histogram.

```{r}
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: This is a histogram
set.seed(4321)

x <- rnorm(100)

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x), 
                 colour = "white",
                 fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
```

An empirical cumulative distribution is also an effective tool @fig-ecdf.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ecdf
#| fig-cap: This is a ecdf.


plot(ecdf(x))

```
